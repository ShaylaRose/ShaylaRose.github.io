<h1> Cages/Bedding/Food

<p> If there is anyone who likes to eat it is these small potatoes. I do not know how or why they act like they are starving all of the time but they will let out a whistle to let you know everytime you move a plastic bag from JC Pennys. Guinea pigs need a balanced diet of nutricious food--They are herbivores. Search up exactly what they can't have on google. They need hay 24/7 otherwise their teeth with grow. Think of the hay as their toothbrush. Pellets 1/3 amount for each piggy. </p>


<h2> Bedding/Cages </h2> 
<p>The bedding I reccomend are tagged below. A brand name "Guinea Dad" That website has every cage and liner for them. Guinea pigs poop for every one pellet they eat and I get tired of maintenence so having appropriate thick bedding is worth it. Also, every piggy needs a lot of space. a 56' by 24 should do the trick for two piggies. They can stay outdoors or indoors.</p>
<p>

	<h3>Cute Cages</h3>

	<p> Below are some creative ideas on guinea pig cages. Whenever I clean my piggies cage or put new toys in there they do a "popcorn" dance. It is the cutet thing in the world to watch them do because you know they are happy. Here are some popcorn dance worthy cage ideas! </p>

<h2>Do Not forget that piggies need self assisted care! Just as we need to trim our nails and take showers so do the piggies! They are natually very dirty animals. I would say give them a bath maybe once a month if they are filthy but they usually do a good job with cleaning. Their nails get very long and sharp so I stay on top of that around 3 times a month. As for the skinny pig breed they need to be oiled and lotioned otherwise they develop very bad skin conditions. This is also the reason why I said they are better with mature teens and/or adults to care for them. </h2>

<h3>Communication</h3>


<p>It is very important to know the types of guinea pig noises so that you can understand what the piggies want in life. I have only heard my piggy screetch once when her nail was stuck in her bedding and she could not get out. Another time I was trimming my piggies nails on a high table and she jumped right off! I would say she knew how high it was but unfortunetly for her she was hungry. These noises give me and others cues to their guinea pigs needs and wants. The story I just told does not depict their intelligence in the right way but they are extremely intuitive. </p>
