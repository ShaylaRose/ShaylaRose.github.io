<h4>Facts about guinea pigs</h4>

<p>All guinea pigs look different but mostly are for mature people. If you are looking to buy/adopt one I highly recommend them as ESA pets. They are very high maintenence and even though they do not cost a lot of money they will in the long run because of the cost of care. Most people give them their own rooms but I keep my two piggies in mine. </p>
