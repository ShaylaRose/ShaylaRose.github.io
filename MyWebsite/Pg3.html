 <p style="font-size:160%;"> <strong> Binary systems rotate around their center of mass and I know from the textbook that the higher the mass of the star the closer the center of mass. For Capella two stars push and the other recede in their orbit. Mass measurements are crucial to understanding and expanding a theory of how stars evolve. Capella A has a yellowish-white color and has an apparent magnitude of around 0.08, making it one of the brightest stars we can see from Earth. Capella A the star's has a surface temperature of  which is approximately 5,500 degrees. In terms of motion, Capella Aa and Capella Ab orbit around their common center of mass, completing one orbit in about 104 days. Capella -B- H and Capella L, the other binary pair, also revolve around each other. The motion of these stars provides valuable insights into their masses, distances, and orbital dynamics.

 	Capella apparent brightness ranks it the 6th star in the sky. With Siruis being number one. Capella makes a very attractive sight for not only astronomers but stargazers. You can see it best in the northern sky throughout the entire year at night mostly since it is located in Auriga constellation. Though, in the winter’s northeastern evening’s you can see the stars apparent brightness as well. During the winter for the Southern hemisphere you should be able to catch this beautiful star. It is also important to note that Capella Aa is a G-type giant star, and it has a yellowish color, while Capella H, L are both K-type giants, and they have a orange and red type color. Most stars like Capella A have elements like hydrogen and helium, keeping the stars brightness ever flowing with nuclear fusion (till it dies). Capella B, H, and L also have hydrogen and helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Meaning they are older. Capella H is a smaller fainter red dwarf star. From observations in the article E Bozzo et. al  “The black and red lines represent the barycentred radial velocity along the orbits of the two Capella’s components (Aa and Ab) derived from the orbital parameters as in Strassmeier et al. (2020). The green points with the corresponding error bars are the corrected Doppler velocities obtained from the Chandra observations.”
Capella is far from dying! Even though it is in its second half of its life stage Capella A will be predicted to turn into a white dwarf star. This star will not die for several billion years. I would think because this is a quadruple star system and it is the 6th most luminous star in the sky that when it does die it might create beautiful dust that resembles the nebulae. Although it will not go supernova Capella A is only considered a type G-star.
