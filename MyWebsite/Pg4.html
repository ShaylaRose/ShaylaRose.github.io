<h1>Cons About Guinea Pigs</h1>
<body style="background-color:lavenderblush;">

<h1>The Poop!</h1>

<p><strong>If you were living in the 90's then you can picture one of those old pezz dispensers. Yeah... That is exactly what it looks like when they poo! Not only do they go everytime they eat but the upkeep for guinea pigs is very time consuming!</strong></p>

<h2>Quality Time</h2>

<p> If you do not have one or two hours atleast every other day your guinea pigs are a great candidate for depression. They are very sensitive creatures and any change in their diets, food amount, and even quality time with you will weigh heavy on their mental health. They need quality time not only with their humans but with their own species. They are not recommended to be in a cage by themselves unless they are violent towards another piggy, you should at least always have two of them in the cage! Like I said they will die of depression and are very social. They come from a the moutains of Peru and there are like 100 of them at large in groups. </p>

<h2>Needy</h2>

<p>They are very needy. It is like being in another relationship at times even though it is a balanced relationship and the piggies give the amount of love they receive they are suseptible to certain diseases. They can get cancer, and small things like an upper respitory disease can kill them! Luckily I have not experienced any of that so far! They can get ringworm (which can kill them) and far more diseases. Did I also mentio they can die of heat exhaust? YUP they can ! They cannot be too cold or too hot without something negative possibly happening. </p>

<h2>A Bit Of a Pain In The Butt</h2>

<p>Guinea pigs are not too vocally loud animals but they can be if they do not get fed on schedule. If you are even 10 minutes late in feeding them they know! all I hear is WHEE WHEE while I try to get some sleep in my room. It reminds me of a very annoying roommate I once had that did not know the word courtesy after 12am. Besides the point these guinea pigs will scream and cry until they get what they want and will bite the cage. Here is a story about Piggy before I intregrated her and Hazel into one cage. I got them separate cages because they did not get along at first glance. Piggy was so depressed because hazel would not accept her that she used to bit on the metal parts of her cage until I let her see Hazel. This meant my staying up all night. Nothing would make her stop. I got Hazel and Piggy a bigger cage and they are thriving as roommates ! </p>



<h2>Expensive</h2>
 
 <p> I dont know why I did not listen to Google when it came down to caring for the guinea pigs in all aspects such as their bedding, laundry, toys, food, bowls, timothy hay, and, clippers but they are very expensive. Me and you know Mc Donalds can fill up a person for 5 dollars but not these guys. They need fruits and vegetables and with this inflation it is true that their groceries can cost 25-30 bucks if that a week. As a college student it can be hard to maintain their diet. Their guinea pig liners that I tagged in page 2 are 40-60 dollars for ONE. They last for 6 months but then I have to do their laundry. These things such as timothy hay and pellets can really add up. Sometimes I feel bad because I know they deserve more toys. But they are loved. </p>
