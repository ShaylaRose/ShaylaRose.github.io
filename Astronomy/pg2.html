<h1> Paragraph 2 </h1>

<p style="font-size:160%;"> <strong> In Astronomy Edward C. Pickering (1846-1919) paved the way to the discovery of binary stars. Pickering observed firstly the star named “Mizar”. In general even though binary star systems are common and Capella is considered to be a quadruple star system the spectroscopic binary method was used to identify this brightest stars system quantity. Usually the Doppler method tells us -as long as the stars are not perpendicular to eachother- there are more then one star in this system. Like many other star systems Capella is not alone with the commonality of having more then one star in the quadruple system of stars. The four stars in the Capella system are named Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L. Capella Aa and Capella Ab form one binary pair, while Capella H and Capella L make up the other binary pair. Each star has different qualities about them. We use our Sun  to compare the size of Capella’s. Our sun in reference has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Capella A is estimated to have a diameter of around 16.6 million kilometers. So, Capella A is significantly larger than our Sun. Capella B consists of two smaller stars, Capella B L and Capella B H. While I don't have the exact size measurements for Capella B L and Capella B H, they are smaller in size compared to our sun.
